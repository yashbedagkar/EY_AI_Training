[/INST]", "response": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties and adjusts its actions to maximize cumulative rewards over time. It's like learning through trial and error, with the goal of finding the best strategy (policy) to achieve a task. Key concepts include: - **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker (e.g., a robot, game-playing AI). - **Environment**: The system the agent interacts with (e.g., a game, real-world setting). - **State**: The current situation the agent observes. - **Action**: The choices the agent can take. - **Reward**: Feedback (positive or negative) from the environment. - **Policy**: The strategy the agent uses to decide actions. - **Value Function**: Estimates the expected cumulative reward for a state or action. RL is used in robotics, game AI, autonomous vehicles, and more. Examples include AlphaGo and self-driving cars.", "feedback": null}
