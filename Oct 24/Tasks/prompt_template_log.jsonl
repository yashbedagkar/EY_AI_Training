These neural networks are inspired by the human brain, recognizing complex structures in data, like images, text, or sounds. For example, a deep learning model can be trained to recognize cats in photos by learning from thousands of labeled images. The more data and layers it has, the better it gets at its task. It's used in applications like voice assistants, self-driving cars, and recommendation systems."}
