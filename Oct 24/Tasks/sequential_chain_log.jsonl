Unlike narrow AI, which excels in specific tasks, AGI aims to replicate the flexibility and adaptability of human intelligence. It involves advanced machine learning, reasoning, and problem-solving skills. While still theoretical, achieving AGI could revolutionize technology, work, and daily life.", "quiz_questions": " 1.
