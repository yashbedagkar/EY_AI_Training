    "question": "Define Newton's First Law",
    "answer": "Newton's First Law, also known as the Law of Inertia, states that an object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force. This means that objects naturally resist changes in their state of motion, which is the property of inertia. The law highlights that force is required to change the motion of an object, whether to start it moving, stop it, or alter its direction or speed.",

    "question": "Define RAG",
    "answer": "<s> [OUT] RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a technique in artificial intelligence that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models to improve the quality and relevance of generated responses. Here's a breakdown of the term:\n\n1. **Retrieval**: This component involves fetching relevant information from a large database or knowledge source (like documents, web pages, or structured data) based on the input query. The retrieved information is then used to inform the generation process.\n\n2. **Augmented**: The retrieved information \"augments\" or enhances the generative model's knowledge, allowing it to produce more accurate, contextually relevant, and factually grounded responses.\n\n3. **Generation**: This is the part where the AI generates a response, but unlike traditional generative models that rely solely on their pre-trained knowledge, RAG models use the retrieved information to guide the generation, leading to better results.\n\n### Key Features of RAG:\n- **Dynamic Knowledge**: Unlike static models, RAG can access up-to-date information by retrieving it at the time of generation.\n- **Transparency**: Since the generated response is based on retrievable sources, the model can provide references or citations, making it more trustworthy.\n- **Scalability**: RAG can leverage large external knowledge bases without needing to retrain the model, making it adaptable to new information.\n\n### Applications:\n- **Question Answering**: Providing accurate answers to complex queries by retrieving relevant documents.\n- **Chatbots**: Enhancing conversational agents with real-time, context-aware responses.\n- **Content Creation**: Generating articles, reports, or summaries based on retrieved data.\n\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the AI needs to handle domain-specific or rapidly changing information, as it can dynamically access and incorporate the latest data.",

    "question": "Define Newton's second law",
    "answer": "Newton's second law of motion states that the net force (F) acting on an object is equal to the mass (m) of the object multiplied by its acceleration (a). Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\nF = m × a\n\nThis law describes how the motion of an object changes in response to an applied force. Key points include:\n1. **Force and Acceleration**: The greater the net force applied to an object, the greater its acceleration, assuming mass is constant.\n2. **Mass and Inertia**: The more massive an object, the less it accelerates under the same force (since mass resists changes in motion, a property called inertia).\n3. **Direction**: The direction of the net force is the same as the direction of the acceleration.\n\nThis law is fundamental in classical mechanics and is used to analyze and predict the motion of objects under various forces.",
